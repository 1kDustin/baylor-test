This allows for easier splicing of rolls and anchoring to corners by adding a 12” tail at the beginning of each roll and a 6” tail at the end. Versi-Tail allows for faster installation by eliminating the need to remove cross-wire staples to allow enough tail for tying to corners or splicing rolls. Class III Galvanized Horse Fence resists corrosion which results in a longer fence life. Continuous vertical and horizontal wires, wrapped in a horse-safe knot with a third wire, provides the strength and rigidity as well as the safety needed for your prized animals.">

                                           <h3>Take Gennex® Outside</h3>
                                           <p>Gennex colorants help our exterior paints stand up to the harshest weather conditions in all colors. 

                                                This image shows Aura® Exterior paint tinted with Gennex colorants. Compared to its closest national competitor–after exposing both to third‐party outdoor accelerated weather testing–Aura exterior retains its original color and fades less. 
                                                
                                                Years after painting with Benjamin Moore Gennex-engineered paints, homeowners feel confident in the investment they made. And Gennex’s long-lasting results help strengthen professionals’ reputations.</p>
